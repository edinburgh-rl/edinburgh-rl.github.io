          We are an interest group focused on Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, based at the University of Edinburgh.
          Formerly known as the Autonomous Agents Research Group, we hold regular reading group meetings where invited speakers present the latest
          developments in the field. You can learn more <Link href={"/reading-group"}>here</Link>.
