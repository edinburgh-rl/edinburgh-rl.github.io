# University of Edinburgh Reinforcement Learning Group website
This is the code for the website, written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The website uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for styling.

## Running locally
Before you run locally, ensure that you have installed **Node 22**. Then, install the required dependencies by running:
```
npm i
```
Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can run the local dev version by running the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
This will spin up a local development server that will service the website while developing. You can usually access the local version of the website at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (the terminal will give you the url to access the website).
