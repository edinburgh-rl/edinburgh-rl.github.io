# Testing how text is displayed
In this section we are testing how text is displayed on the page.

## Italic text
This sentence includes *italic* text. To display it, we've used a standard markdown syntax with the asterisk. In this sentence we also use <i>italic</i> but this time we have used the HTML tag \<i>

## Bold text
Now we are testing how **bold** text is displayed. In this example we used the double asterisk (\**). And of course, we now test <b>bold</b> using the HTML variant.

## Strikethrough text
Here we test how ~strikethrough~ text works. The HTML equivalent is to use the \<s> tag. For example <s>strikethough</s>

## Subscript and superscript
Water, chemically known as H<sub>2</sub>O, is essential for life. One of the most famous equation in physics is E=mc<sup>2</sup>.

## Underlined text
Sometimes we might want to emphasize about something <ins>important</ins>. In this case we use the \<ins> HTML tag.

## Quotations
When we want to cite someone else, we should use the quotations block.
> Stay hungry. Stay foolish - Steve Jobs

## Code blocks
### Code or command within the line
We can denote a piece of code or command within a sentence. For example, if we're talking about the method `sum()`.

### Code or command in a block without a programming language
```
do_step_one()
do_step_two()
```

### Code in a specific language
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

## Links
You can find a basic markdown guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
You can also create a link to a [heading](#testing-how-text-is-displayed) in the article.

## Lists
### Unordered list
Here we are testing an unordered list:
- item 1
- item 2
    - item 2, part 1
    - item 2, part 2
- item 3

### Ordered list
1. item 1
2. item 2
    1. item 2, part 1
    2. item 2, part 2
3. item 3

### Mixed list
1. item 1
2. item 2
    - part 1
    - part 2
3. item 3

## Task Lists
- [x] Task one
- [ ] Task two
- [ ] Task three

## Writing footnotes

# Images
You can use the basic markdown syntax to display images:
```
![alt text](url)
```
This will produce the following:
![Example image](/images/blog/default.png)

However, we might want to style this image. For example, we might want to make resize it. In this case, we can use 
standard HTML `<img>` tag.
<img src="/images/blog/default.png" alt="Example picture" width="300"/>

If we want to add a figure with caption, we can use the following HTML code:
```HTML
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image" width="300"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 1: This is the caption.</figcaption>
</figure>
```
This would produce the following:
<figure>
  <img src="/images/blog/default.png" alt="Description of image" width="300"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 1: This is the caption. We want to test adding a lot of text here</figcaption>
</figure>

# Tables
Here we show how tables work:
| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |

You can centre the table using a custom component `<Centered>`:
```jsx
<Centered>
// Your table goes here
</Centered>
```
The result is:
<Centered>
| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
</Centered>

You can add a caption to the table with a custom component `<WithCaption>` like so:
```jsx
<WithCaption caption="Figure 2: My table">
| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
</WIthCaption>
```
This produces the following:
<WithCaption caption="Figure 2: My table">
| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
</WithCaption>

# Maths
Finally, we want to show how to write `LaTeX` equations. You can write an inline equation like $1 + 2 = 3$ by writing `$1+2=3$`.

To write this in a block, you can surround your equation like so:
```
$$
E=mc^2
$$
```
to produce the following:
$$
E = mc^2
$$
