title: Breaking the Performance Ceiling in Reinforcement Learning requires Inference Strategies.
abstract: Reinforcement Learning systems often struggle on real-world problems that are highly  combinatorial and require complex coordination. Even state-of-the-art policies, trained to convergence, hit a performance ceiling with zero-shot inference. However, many deployment scenarios allow extra compute at execution time. This talk demonstrates that using inference-time strategies is essential to overcome this ceiling. Empirical results across 17 challenging multi-agent RL benchmarks show gains up to 126% and an average of 45% performance improvement over prior state-of-the-art, using just a few seconds of extra wall-clock time. Powered by over 60,000 runs, this is the most comprehensive empirical study on inference strategies in complex RL to date.

bio: The RL research team at InstaDeep develops scalable methods for complex sequential decision-making, focusing on multi-agent RL, combinatorial optimisation, and inference-time strategies. The team has introduced several state-of-the-art approaches, including SABLE, COMPASS, and MEMENTO. Its recent NeurIPS 2025 oral work demonstrates how inference-time search can dramatically improve performance across challenging real-world tasks.
